# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project predicts the salary based on years of experience using a simple linear regression model. 

## Dataset:
The dataset contains two columns:
- YearsExperience: Number of years of work experience.
- Salary: The salary in USD.

## Steps:
1. Data preprocessing and visualization.
2. Training a linear regression model.
3. Evaluating model performance using MSE and RÂ² score.
4. Visualizing the results.
5. Predicting salary for new inputs.
